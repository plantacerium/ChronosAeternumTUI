**Chronos Plantacerium** is a sacred horological instrument designed to transform the ephemeral passage of time into a permanent inventory of human experience. It is a **Digital Zen Time Garden**—a space where every minute is a petal, and every note is a seed of consciousness.

## [SYSTEM_OVERVIEW]

![Chronos Plantacerium](./assets/chronos-aeternum.JPG)

### � MEDITATIVE GEOMETRY
The **Vault of Flow** is a high-fidelity environment designed to induce a state of temporal presence.

*   **The Golden Breath**: Concentric energy rings follow a **4-1-8 breathing cycle** (Inhale 4s, Hold 1s, Exhale 8s), visually guiding your own respiration while you observe the archive.
*   **Vector Lotus Crown**: 12 precision-carved petals rotate in a grounding reverse-orbit, framing the clock with sacred geometry.
*   **Gilded Spirit Beacon**: A solitary point of light that tracks the exact minute, moving with the fluid grace of a floating petal on a still pond.
*   **Chromatic Stillness**: A curated palette of Royal Gold and Deep Void designed to minimize cognitive load and maximize focus.

---

## [THE_RITUAL_OF_ARCHIVING]

Usage of the Plantacerium is intended as a daily ritual of presence.

1.  **CENTER**: Align your breathing with the 4-1-8 expansion of the golden rings.
2.  **NAVIGATE**: Use Arrow Keys to gently drift through the 60 minutes of the hour.
3.  **LEAP**: Use Up/Down keys to jump between 5-minute petal markers.
4.  **INVOKE**: Press `Enter` to open the memory vault.
5.  **PLANT**: Record your presence. Use **Markdown** to structure your thoughts like architecture.
6.  **SEAL**: Press `Esc` to lock the node. Your memory is now banked in the **Minute-Level Key** (`YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm`).

## [INITIATION_SEQUENCE]

Prepare your terminal for the descent into precision.

```bash
# Clone the gilded lotus
git clone https://github.com/plantacerium/ChronosAeternumTUI

# Enter the archival sanctuary
cd ChronosAeternumTUI

# Awaken the instrument
cargo run
```

## [THE_ZEN_OF_TIME]

> *"Feel the breath of the lotus. Every minute is a universe waiting for its chronicler."*

In the noise of the modern world, we often lose the 'weight' of our hours. By banking our experiences with **Minute-Precision**, we turn the ephemeral into the eternal. Each note is a golden petal dropped into the silent pool of the archive.

*Designed for the elite observer. Built with gold, breath, and precision.*
